## Blog Posts

I wanted to create a blog section for my site and I was really interested in using MDX. [Kent C Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) used MDXBundler to build his site. There was also an early remix stack I'll find the name that I really liked but a lot of this could be done with things more server side.

### plugins used for MDX (not)

- [reading-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time)
