# Goals for 2025

## Let's Go!
I recently took down my personal site as I felt it was too bloated and wasn't showcasing what I intended to showcase. Afterwards I changed my mind and decided to start a new version of the personal web app. The new version of the web app has 3 primary goals:
1. **Showcase my Curriculum Vitae**: 
   - I want to make it easy for people to find my CV and see what I am up to.
2. **Create a small blog to showcase my thoughts or ideas**:
    - I want to be able to write about things that interest me and share them with the world but mostly for myself. I will iterate on the blog with liking and commenting. .
3. **Enter a maintenance phase**:
    - I want to add features to the site but prioritize the presence of the blog and CV. Therefore I will not push any breaking code to production.
